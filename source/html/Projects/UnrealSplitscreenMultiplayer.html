          <p>
            During my work at Red Kite Games, I was asked to take one of their existing projects and add Split-Screen functonality to it.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Four Player Local and Server/Client functionality:</b>
             The system I created allowed for up to four players to being playing together on one machine or across multiple machines in a
             Server/client environment. 
            </li>
             <li><b>Adjustable Split-Screen layout:</b>
              Whenever a new player was added to a game, the split-screen layout would dynamically change to a custom set layout based on how many players
              were playing on a particular machine.         
            </li>
             <li><b>Drop-in/Drop-out implementation across all modes:</b>
              Players had the option to start a match and add/remove players by just pressing a button on a controller. This meant that players could
              join or leave a game at any momemnt either locally or in a server/client environment.
            </li>
            <li><b>Refactored codebase to allow for local multiplayer:</b>
              The game was initially designed with the intention of only having one player per system, so I had to go through the codebase and find issues and fix bug
              that realated to in game logic assuming that there would only ever be one player on one machine.
            </li>
          </ul>
