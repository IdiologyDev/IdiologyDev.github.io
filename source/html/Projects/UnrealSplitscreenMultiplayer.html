          <p>
            During my work at Red Kite Games, I was asked to take one of their existing projects and add Split-Screen functionality to it.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Four Player Local and Server/Client functionality:</b>
             The system I created allowed for up to four players to being playing together on one machine or across multiple machines in a
             Server/client environment. 
            </li>
             <li><b>Adjustable Split-Screen layout:</b>
              Whenever a new player was added to a game, the split-screen layout would dynamically change to a custom set layout based on how many players
              were playing on a particular machine.         
            </li>
             <li><b>Drop-in/Drop-out implementation across all modes:</b>
              Players had the option to start a match and add/remove players by just pressing a button on a controller. This meant that players could
              join or leave a game at any moment either locally or in a server/client environment.
            </li>
            <li><b>Refactored codebase to allow for local multiplayer:</b>
              The game was initially designed with the intention of only having one player per system, so I had to go through the codebase and fix bugs
              that occurred due to the game being designed around the assumption that there was only one player per computer.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Project Reflections</h2>
          <p> 
           One part of this project I'm really proud of are the optimisations I found. As I implemented split-screen, I used profiling tools such as Unreal Insights, RenderDoc and Pix to investigate how much more processing it took to render the extra players. When I did this, I found
           there were several areas within the code that could be optimised for rendering (both in single player and local multiplayer) and I was able to achieve significant framerate improvements on high-end hardware.
