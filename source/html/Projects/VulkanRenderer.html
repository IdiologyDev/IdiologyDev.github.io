          <p>
            The Vulkan Renderer is a project that I have developed in my own time in order to provide a means 
            to work my own game projects as well as experiment with various rendering techniques and technologies.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Mesh Shaders:</b>
              Mesh Shaders are a new emerging rendering technology that allow triangles to be dynamically created in a shader without having to pass in any vertex data.
              In order to explore this new technology, I implemented it into my Vulkan Renderer and created shaders to explore per-triangle culling, proceadural terrain generation and dynamic LODs.          
            </li>
             <li><b>Texture Arrays:</b>
              I added in texture arrays in order to have a better way to render sprites that share the same dimensions. While sprites are normally batched into a single files and then rendered by specifying the offsets within a file,
              using texture arrays means that hundreds or thousands of sprites can be dynamically loaded in/out of memory and inserted/removed from the texture array as needed, which mantains the efficent rendering.          
            </li>
             <li><b>Deffered Rendering:</b>
              As I developed a Vulkan Renderer, I created a Deffered Rendering system that took advantage of Vulkan's Render pass system, meaning that mobile GPUs are optimised for it. This renderer passes in the position, depth, albedo and normals
              into a set of render targets. These targets are then processed in a seperate pass in order to produce the regular image whist doing lighting calculations on point lights, which allows for more efficent dynamic lighting.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Project Reflections</h2>
          <p>          
           As this is renderer is being frequently updated to support new functonality, I am continously facing new challenges and learning new things. There were several systems that I had to refactor 
           when introducing a new feature such as Texture Arrays in order to mantain compability with the exisiting interfaces. Additionally, it took several attempts to find a level of abstraction where 
           I could produce easy to use interfaces whilst reducing the amount of duplication of code in the backend.
